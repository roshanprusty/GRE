Hey guys,
  I had to do this in a hurry as I have a lot of pending pre-departure work. I have headed to Duke to pursue my masters in Engineering Management. I had admits for MS in ECE as well, but decided to pursue my interest in technology leadership and so opted for MEM. I will be flying on 10th Aug, so I don't have much time. I will keep updating this space to brings all stufff under one umberella.
